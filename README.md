# Cricket-Team-Splitter

Welcome to the Cricket Team Splitter application! This web-based tool helps you create balanced cricket teams by allowing you to add players with specified roles and automatically distributing them into teams. It features an intuitive user interface, dark mode support, and the ability to download team configurations as a PDF.

**Background**

The idea for this application emerged during a discussion at our office about playing cricket. We encountered a problem in splitting teams equally, which led me to come up with this solution. I developed this small web application as a starting point i got some ideas using Chatgpt and then optimized it according to our needs. The result is the Cricket Team Splitter, a tool designed to help anyone facing similar challenges in organizing balanced cricket teams. Please check out this web application and see how it can simplify your team selection process.
